I'm excited you stumbled across my website! 

My name is Tim and these are a few titles I claim:
 * proud father
 * banking nerd
 * joyful christian
 * local history nut
 * recovering theologian

You will find a wide variety of articles and topics on this site. Many of my most exciting articles combine a number of my passions to produce a strange fusion of diverse disciplines. 

I hope you enjoy!
