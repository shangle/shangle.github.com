7 Ways Seminary Shaped Me as a Community Banker

Seminary and banking.

They seem like two institutions that are miles apart from one another. They are both filled with specializations. Each has it's own culture and tribes. 

But they are similar. 

They share a lot in common. 

Even more than their choice of names that use the words first and  community.

Though I may not be parsing Greek in community banking, seminary taught me several things. It was foundational in shaping the way I approach my career at a bank. 

1. Success Outside the Building

2. 10-80-10  Pareto Principle  

3. Passion

4. Hidden Emotions

5. Mega is Not Us

6. Foundational to the Community

7. No One Understands
